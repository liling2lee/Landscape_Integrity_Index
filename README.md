# Landscape Integrity Index
This is a GIS model of Landscape Integrity Index (LII), which includes python scripts and R Markdown.
The first edition is the original code used to create the LII model. The second edition is a more current version that shortened the code. 

Please refer to "Using Landscape Integrity Index to Evaluate the Cumulative Impacts of BLM Resource Management Programs" thesis by Liling Lee to read more about the project and the process.

ABSTRACT: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is instrumental in connecting people with
public lands by providing and protecting opportunities to enjoy and use our country’s resources.
Understanding the cumulative effects of resource management programs is crucial for decision
makers to develop effective land management practices and appropriate allocation of funding
and resources. A comprehensive, standardized, and transparent GIS workflow can help visualize
and analyze ecological integrity, landscape patterns and processes, and promote a consistent
Cumulative Effects Analysis (CEA) and collaborative management across jurisdiction
boundaries.

This research evaluates the cumulative impacts of resource management programs in the
BLM Carlsbad Field Office (CFO), New Mexico by incorporating ecological integrity indicators,
resource- and stressor-based metrics, and landscape metrics to create a Landscape Integrity Index
(LII). Two resource management programs, Vegetative Communities and Minerals – Leasables –
Oil and Gas, were selected as the programs of interest for this study. The LII model considers the
management goals and objectives in the Draft BLM CFO Resource Management Plan (RMP) to
identify the necessary indicators and metrics. These indicators and metrics were each scored for
their site impact, distance decay function, or landscape metrics through the use of a Composite
Scoring System, and then combined into a single map. The resulting map with the LII values
shows areas of low landscape integrity near the urban and agricultural areas in CFO planning
area and high landscape integrity near central and southwest corner of CFO. CEA practitioners
and land managers will be able to address management goals and objectives, conduct a more
systematic and consistent analysis with relevant indicators and metrics, and visualize landscape
integrity using the LII framework.
